# Origin of the Biskiod

![Biskiod Etymology Diagram](/assets/imgs/biskiod_etymology_diagram.png)

Although my name is Chase Yakaboski, over the years many of my friends have add their own personal spin, leading to a complicated etimology that I will attempt to describe here. Starting in middle school, "Chase" was quickly dropped in favor of a segment of my last name, "Boski." "Yak" was also contender at this time but never really caught on as it was my father's Air Force callsign (i.e. far too prosaic). "Boski" stuck for a while and became my defacto nickname through high school as well.

Into college "Boski" saw it's first major shift. It began with a variety of remixes such as, dropping the "i" to become "Bosk" and replacing the "o" with "i" to become "Biski." For some reason, "Biski" seemed to stick and replaced "Boski" as my primary nickname. Over the next couple years, my name has continued to develop iterations such as "Bisque", "Biskit", and "Biskiod," while still maintaining the base "Bisk" sound.  As I am currently in a AI/ML PhD program and most of the content on this blog will be focused on AI, machine learning and general software engineering, I thought adopting "Biskiod" as my blog personal was the most appropriate as it provides a nice combination between my most current nickname iteration and "Andriod."
