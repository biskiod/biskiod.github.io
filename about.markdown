# Origin of the Biskiod.

My given name is Chase Yakaboski, but over the years many of my friends have add their own personal spin on it. "Chase" was quickly dropped in middle school in favor of "Boski," "Yak" was a contender but given that it was my father's Air Force call sign, it was removed from consideration. "Boski" stuck for a while and became my defacto nickname through high school.

However, into college "Boski" began to be remixed in a variety of ways: dropping the "i" to become "Bosk" and replacing the "o" with "i" to become "Biski." For some reason, "Biski" seemed to stick and has replaced "Boski" as my primary nnickname, particularly because it is easier to add into a rhyme, "The Friski Biski," for instance. Over the next couple years after college, my name has continued to develop with iterations such as "Bisque", "Biskit", and "Biskiod." As a currently in a AI/ML PhD program and most of the content on this blog will be focused on AI, machine learning and general software engineering, I thought a fit name for the blog would be "Biskiod:" a nice combination between my most current nickname iteration and "Andriod."
